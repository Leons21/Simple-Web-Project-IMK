            Kyler Murray Will Take The Field At State Farm Stadium For The First
            Time Since Tearing The Acl In His Right Knee There 11 Months Ago.
            Cardinals Head Coach Jonathan Gannon Confirmed As Much Friday.<br /><br />the
            Cardinals Would Be Wise To Take A Cautious Approach To How Murray Is
            Used In His First Game Action — Which Means Leaning On Running The
            Football Sunday Against The Atlanta Falcons, Using Play-action
            Passes To Create Some Clean Throwing Lanes Down The Field And
            Limiting Designed Runs.<br /><br />&#34;we&#39;ve Got To Be Willing
            To Understand That It Might Not Look Like Kyler,&#34; Cardinals Head
            Coach Jonathan Gannon Said, When Asked This Week About His
            Expectations For Murray. &#34;and I Think He Has A Good Expectation
            Of That. The Coaches Have A Good Expectation Of That. But I Know
            This: He&#39;s Going To Come Out There, Play His Game And Help Us
            Win.&#34;<br /><br />while Gannon Alluded To The Possibility That He
            Might Have Some Rust To Shake Off, Murray Told Reporters This Week
            He Still Must Play To His Strengths — The Things That Made Him The
            No. 1 Overall Pick In The 2019 Draft.<br /><br />&#34;he Told Me
            That To My Face And I Kind Of Laughed At Him,&#34; Murray Said When
            Asked By Reporters This Week About Gannon&#39;s Comments. &#34;i
            Understand That Thought Process, But Every Time I Touch The Field,
            I&#39;m Trying To Do My Thing. And That&#39;s Obviously Win — But Do
            It At A High Level. I Understand The Thought Process Of ‘hey, Take
            It Slow. Don&#39;t Be Too Hard On Yourself.&#39;<br /><br />&#34;because
            I Missed All Of The (training) Camp Reps. I Missed All Of The
            Preseason. This Is Week 9, Week 10 – Whatever It Is — And I&#39;ve
            Missed All Of This Time. So, To Go Into It Thinking That, I Hear
            What He&#39;s Saying. But That&#39;s Not In My Thought
            Process.&#34;<br /><br />it Will Be Up To Gannon And Offensive
            Coordinator Drew Petzing To Manage Murray And Expectations — Putting
            Him In The Best Place To Succeed Over The Next Eight Weeks — As
            Arizona Evaluates How The 26-year-old Signal Caller Fits In The
            Team&#39;s New Offensive Scheme And Whether He&#39;s The Long-term
            Answer At The Position.<br /><br />the Cardinals Have Two
            First-round Selections In The Upcoming Draft — Arizona&#39;s Own
            Pick And The Houston Texans&#39; Via Draft-day Trade Last Year — And
            11 Picks Overall. If The Season Were To End Now, 1-8 Arizona Would
            Pick No. 2 Overall (the Bears, Via Carolina Would Pick First Due To
            A Strength-of-schedule Tiebreaker). But The Addition Of Murray Could
            Change All Of That If He Can Lead The Cardinals To Some Wins During
            The Second Half Of The Season.<br /><br />arizona General Manager
            Monti Ossenfort Could Have His Sights Set On Bringing In A Franchise
            Quarterback Like Caleb Williams Or Drake Maye On A Rookie Deal And
            Building Around A New Cornerstone.<br />in That Scenario, The
            Cardinals Would Have To Consider The Cap Implications And
            Roster-building Possibilities Of Moving On From Murray Via Trade Or
            Outright Release, Then Integrating An Unknown Rookie Quarterback Who
            Has Never Played In The League.<br /><br />murray Is Guaranteed To
            Make $35 Million In 2024. And On The Fifth Day Of The New League
            Year On March 17, $18 Million Due In 2025 Becomes Fully
            Guaranteed.<br />those Are Not Unreasonable Sums For A Top-notch
            Quarterback Playing Well And Leading A Franchise — The Contract
            Still Allows Some Financial Flexibility For Ossenfort To Build
            Around Him. And Murray&#39;s Presence On The Roster Is One Of The
            Reasons Gannon Took The Job In Arizona.<br /><br />sunday Also
            Provides The First Chance To See How Murray Fits Into A New System
            That Will Have Him Under Center For The First Time In His Pro
            Career. Petzing&#39;s Version Of The West Coast Offense Leans On
            More Two-tight-end Sets, With A Power Running Game That Sets Up The
            Play-action Pass.<br /><br />former Arizona Quarterback Joshua Dobbs
            Led All Quarterbacks With 258 Rushing Yards Before Being Traded To
            The Minnesota Vikings Last Week. Murray, A Better Athlete, Should
            Have Some Schemed-up Opportunities To Make Plays With His Feet.<br />the
            Cardinals Are No. 6 In The Nfl In Rushing, Averaging 4.8 Yards Per
            Carry. Arizona&#39;s 69 Attempts In Play-action Are No. 10 In The
            League.<br /><br />&#34;he&#39;s Healthy. He&#39;s Ready To Go,&#34;
            Petzing Told Reporters When Asked If He Would Limit Murray&#39;s
            Ability As A Runner. &#34;we&#39;re Going To Put Him In A Position
            To Be Successful. I Think That&#39;s Always The Nature When You Have
            A Franchise Quarterback, And You See That Around The League.<br />&#34;when
            They Are Very Mobile, There&#39;s An Injury Risk That&#39;s
            Associated With That. So, We Have To Manage That, As All Teams With
            Elite Quarterbacks Do. But He&#39;s Going To Do What Puts Us In The
            Best Position To Win The Game.&#34;<br /><br />while There Has Been
            A Lot Of Noise Surrounding Murray Over The Past Years, From The
            Homework Clause Included In His Five-year, $230.5 Million Contract
            That Runs Through 2028 And Includes $160 Million In Guarantees,
            Rumblings Of His Lack Of Leadership Within The Organization And
            Coming Off His Worst Year Statistically In 2023, The Two-time Pro
            Bowler Says He Doesn&#39;t Feel Like He Has Anything To Prove To The
            League.<br /><br />it&#39;s About Proving To Himself That He Can
            Still Play.<br />&#34;i Don&#39;t Play This Game For Anybody
            Else,&#34; Murray Said. &#34;god Has Blessed Me With The Ability To
            Do What I Do. But It&#39;s For Me, My Family And The People That
            Believe In Me. That&#39;s Why (i Do What I Do).&#34;
